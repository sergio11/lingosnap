LingoSnap is an AI-powered app designed to help you understand and learn languages naturally. Traveling abroad? Seeing a sign in a language you don’t understand? Take a photo and ask any question in your native language. LingoSnap will not only provide a translation but also explain key vocabulary and grammar concepts while guiding you through pronunciation. Every interaction is saved as a **LingoSnap**, allowing you to revisit it anytime for review.
